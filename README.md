# [Project 1: Learning (Long Short-term Memory) LSTM Model](https://jjimenez55993292.github.io/Deep-Learning-LSTM-model/PredictingNextWordInASentence.html)
## Scenario:
### LSTM Model - Predicting The Next Word In A Setence: 
In this project, Build and Deploy Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning. We use Python libraries (NumPy, pickle, Keras, TensorFlow, Pandas), Django, GCP, and Heruko Cloud. We will be working on a text dataset, a book. This project will preprocess the data into a more usable format. Will train and develop an algorithm model using the sequence-based datasets. We will be using Deep Learning (Long Short-term Memory) LSTM model to develop our algorithm model. This model is based on Neural Net-Architecture and provides very high performance on sequence-based datasets. It has a feedback structure helping the model remember the sequence of data input and the changes in the output depending on what is happening to predicit the next word in a setence.

## Implementation:
### Predicting The Next Word In A Setence Website: 
### [Website:The Next Word In A Setence Website](http://jacintojimenez606.pythonanywhere.com/home/)

Django is an open-source web application framework written in Python. It includes advanced functionality like authentication support, management and admin panels, contact forms, comment boxes, file upload support, etc. This gave us the ability to use our developed python model for predicting the next word. Although our model predicts words based on the model we develop, we also must consider that our current model is only about 27 percent accurate. As our training dataset increases, the model's accuracy also increases. We were able to implement the model on our website, and we were able to get something that's workable; however, it does need Improvement. This is the last stage or step in the process of building the project where we host the newly made website using the Django platform. With this completed, we would be able to access our website and run the model from anywhere across the internet.

# [Project 2: Logistic Regression](https://jjimenez55993292.github.io/Jacinto_J_Portfolio/project_4.html)
## Scenario: 
### Credit Card Risks Modeling: 
Credit Card company wants to study the relationships between customer characteristics and whether the customer is likely to default on their credit. Logistic Regression is used to develop a model that calculates the customers' risk of defaulting on their credit.

# [Project 3: Decision Trees](https://jjimenez55993292.github.io/Jacinto_J_Portfolio/Project_Three.html)
## Scenario: 
### Credit Card Risks Modeling: 
In this project, we will be working on a text dataset, a book written by Plato, “The Republic.” This project will preprocess the data into a more usable format. Will train and develop an algorithm model using the sequence-based datasets. We will be using Deep Learning (Long Short-term Memory) LSTM model to develop our algorithm model. This model is based on Neural Net-Architecture and provides very high performance on sequence-based datasets. It has a feedback structure helping the model remember the sequence of data input and the changes in the output depending on what is happening to predicit the next word in a setence.

# [Project 4: Multiple Regression, Qualitative Variables Interactions, Quadratic Regression](https://jjimenez55993292.github.io/Jacinto_J_Portfolio/Project_One.html)
## Scenario:
### Real Estate Regression Modeling:
Have access to a large set of historical data to help analyze relationships between a house's different attributes (such as square footage or the number of bathrooms) and the house's selling price. The regression models will predict house sale prices based on critical variable factors.  The developed regression models will use Multiple Regression, Qualitative Variables Interactions, and Quadratic Regression to develop models. The regression models will help a real estate company set better prices when listing a home for a client. Also, Setting better prices will ensure that listings can be sold within a reasonable amount of time.

# [Project 5: Logistic Regression and Random Forests](https://jjimenez55993292.github.io/Jacinto_J_Portfolio/Project_Two.html)
## Scenario:
### Heart Disease Modeling: 
University Hospital is researching risk factors for heart disease. Have access to a large set of historical data that you can use to analyze patterns between different health indicators (e.g. fasting blood sugar, maximum heart rate, etc.) and the presence of heart disease. Create different logistic regression models that predict whether or not a person is at risk for heart disease. A model like this could eventually be used to evaluate medical records and look for risks that might not be obvious to human doctors.  Also, another model will create a classification random forest model to predict the risk of heart disease and a regression random forest model to predict the maximum heart rate achieved.
