# [Project 1: Second-Order Regression Models](https://wuhin8b1kkvpihrezztacq-on.drv.tw/www.project5.com/project_5.html)
### Scenario:
You are an analyst working for the government, and you have access to a set of historical data that can be used to study the wage growth of the labor force. Governments are interested in studying wage growth patterns based on their economic agenda. This data set has other economic factors that are related to wage growth. You will use this data set to create models for wage growth.



# [Project 2: Logistic Regression](https://wuhin8b1kkvpihrezztacq-on.drv.tw/www.project4.com/project_4.html)
### Scenario: 
You are a risk analyst working for a credit card company. You have access to a set of historical data that can be used to study the relationships between customer characteristics and whether or not they are likely to default on their credit. The company needs to calculate the risk that its customers will default on their credit. 



# [Project 3: Decision Trees](https://wuhin8b1kkvpihrezztacq-on.drv.tw/www.project3.com/Project_Three.html)
### Scenario: 
You are a risk analyst working for a credit card company. You have access to a set of historical data that can be used to study the relationships between customer characteristics and whether or not they are likely to default on their credit. The company needs to calculate the risk that its customers will default on their credit. 


# [Project 4: Multiple Regression, Qualitative Variables Interactions, Quadratic Regression](https://wuhin8b1kkvpihrezztacq-on.drv.tw/www.ProjectOne.com/Project_One.html)
### Scenario:

You are a data analyst working for a real estate company. You have access to a large set of historical data that you can use to analyze relationships between different attributes of a house (such as square footage or the number of bathrooms) and the houseâ€™s selling price. You have been asked to create different regression models to predict sale prices for houses based on critical variable factors. These regression models will help your company set better prices when listing a home for a client. Setting better prices will ensure that listings can be sold within a reasonable amount of time.


# [Project 5: Logistic Regression and Random Forests](https://wuhin8b1kkvpihrezztacq-on.drv.tw/www.project2.com/Project_Two.html)
### Scenario:
You are a data analyst researching risk factors for heart disease at a university hospital. You have access to a large set of historical data that you can use to analyze patterns between different health indicators (e.g. fasting blood sugar, maximum heart rate, etc.) and the presence of heart disease. You have been asked to create different logistic regression models that predict whether or not a person is at risk for heart disease. A model like this could eventually be used to evaluate medical records and look for risks that might not be obvious to human doctors. You have also been asked to create a classification random forest model to predict the risk of heart disease and a regression random forest model to predict the maximum heart rate achieved.
