# [Project 1: Second-Order Regression Models](https://wuhin8b1kkvpihrezztacq-on.drv.tw/www.project5.com/project_5.html)
### Scenario:
You are an analyst working for the government, and you have access to a set of historical data that can be used to study the wage growth of the labor force. Governments are interested in studying wage growth patterns based on their economic agenda. This data set has other economic factors that are related to wage growth. You will use this data set to create models for wage growth.

# [Project 2: Logistic Regression](https://wuhin8b1kkvpihrezztacq-on.drv.tw/www.project4.com/project_4.html)
## Scenario: 
### Credit Card Modeling: 
Credit Card company wants to study the relationships between customer characteristics and whether the customer is likely to default on their credit. Logistic Regression is used to develop a model that calculates the customers' risk of defaulting on their credit.

# [Project 3: Decision Trees](https://wuhin8b1kkvpihrezztacq-on.drv.tw/www.project3.com/Project_Three.html)
## Scenario: 
### Credit Card Modeling: 
Credit Card company wants to study the relationships between customer characteristics and whether or not they are likely to default on their credit. Decision trees are used to develop a model that calculates the customers' risk of defaulting on their credit.

# [Project 4: Multiple Regression, Qualitative Variables Interactions, Quadratic Regression](https://wuhin8b1kkvpihrezztacq-on.drv.tw/www.ProjectOne.com/Project_One.html)
## Scenario:
### Real Estate Regression Modeling:
Have access to a large set of historical data to help analyze relationships between a house's different attributes (such as square footage or the number of bathrooms) and the house's selling price. The regression models will predict house sale prices based on critical variable factors.  The developed regression models will use Multiple Regression, Qualitative Variables Interactions, and Quadratic Regression to develop models. The regression models will help a real estate company set better prices when listing a home for a client. Also, Setting better prices will ensure that listings can be sold within a reasonable amount of time.

# [Project 5: Logistic Regression and Random Forests](https://wuhin8b1kkvpihrezztacq-on.drv.tw/www.project2.com/Project_Two.html)
## Scenario:
### Heart Disease Modeling: 
University Hospital is researching risk factors for heart disease. Have access to a large set of historical data that you can use to analyze patterns between different health indicators (e.g. fasting blood sugar, maximum heart rate, etc.) and the presence of heart disease. Create different logistic regression models that predict whether or not a person is at risk for heart disease. A model like this could eventually be used to evaluate medical records and look for risks that might not be obvious to human doctors.  Also, another model will create a classification random forest model to predict the risk of heart disease and a regression random forest model to predict the maximum heart rate achieved.
